## 1. Introduction

Let's do a quick round and ask everyone how they ended up here.

**Poll Questions for the attendees:**

+ "Do you have a programming background?"

    "A: Not really but I know how to google."

    "B: I know what variables, functions and loops are."

    "C: I can already make working programs in another language."

    "D: I can already code in Python."

+ "Do you have experience using github?"

## 2. Python installation, syntax and examples. ##

This is the passive part. I will give a demonstration for which you can find the resources here: https://github.com/DriesDD/Python-watch

## 3. Getting started: installation of python. ##

Make sure to install Python3 and not Python2. (The mac/linux package called 'Python' is actually Python 2)

https://www.python.org/downloads/

**To test if python is installed:**

Open the terminal / command prompt and run the `python3` command. You should see the version number and details. 

You are now in Python's interactive mode. Try a command like `print("hello BeCode")` or `'Python goes b' + 'r'*10` or a mathematical calculation. You can do everything python can do from your terminal, even using modules!

To exit, use CTRL-Z or run `exit()`.

## 4. Coding!

Now it's time to create a python file!

There are some ideas in the example folder.

Python files end in `.py`.

They can be run in the terminal / command prompt with `python3 example.py`.

If you don't have an IDE (Integrated development environment, a coding application) I would recommend downloading VSCode which is free and works on every platform.
It has many extensions, install the Python extension.

Choose an exercise from the folder or make up your own. The most important thing is to produce some unique code that is yours.

## 5. Debrief.

We ask some people to show off what they made.
